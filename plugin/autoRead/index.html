                        <p class="intro">JavaScript is the programming language of the web and is used by more software
                            developers
                            today than any other programming language. For nearly 25 years this best seller has been the
                            go-to guide for JavaScript programmers. The seventh edition is fully updated to cover the
                            2020 version of JavaScript, and new chapters cover classes, modules, iterators, generators,
                            Promises, async/await, and metaprogramming. You’ll find illuminating and engaging example
                            code throughout.

                            This book is for programmers who want to learn JavaScript and for web developers who want to
                            take their understanding and mastery to the next level. It begins by explaining the
                            JavaScript language itself, in detail, from the bottom up. It then builds on that foundation
                            to cover the web platform and Node.js.

                            Topics include:

                            Types, values, variables, expressions, operators, statements, objects, and arrays
                            Functions, classes, modules, iterators, generators, Promises, and async/await
                            JavaScript’s standard library: data structures, regular expressions, JSON, i18n, etc.
                            The web platform: documents, components, graphics, networking, storage, and threads
                            Node.js: buffers, files, streams, threads, child processes, web clients, and web servers
                            Tools and language extensions that professional JavaScript developers rely on.

                        <p class="intro">JavaScript is the programming language of the web and is used by more software
                            developers
                            today than any other programming language. For nearly 25 years this best seller has been the
                            go-to guide for JavaScript programmers. The seventh edition is fully updated to cover the
                            2020 version of JavaScript, and new chapters cover classes, modules, iterators, generators,
                            Promises, async/await, and metaprogramming. You’ll find illuminating and engaging example
                            code throughout.

                            This book is for programmers who want to learn JavaScript and for web developers who want to
                            take their understanding and mastery to the next level. It begins by explaining the
                            JavaScript language itself, in detail, from the bottom up. It then builds on that foundation
                            to cover the web platform and Node.js.

                            Topics include:

                            Types, values, variables, expressions, operators, statements, objects, and arrays
                            Functions, classes, modules, iterators, generators, Promises, and async/await
                            JavaScript’s standard library: data structures, regular expressions, JSON, i18n, etc.
                            The web platform: documents, components, graphics, networking, storage, and threads
                            Node.js: buffers, files, streams, threads, child processes, web clients, and web servers
                            Tools and language extensions that professional JavaScript developers rely on.
